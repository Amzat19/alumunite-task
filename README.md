## Features

- **Modular Design**: Organized structure with separate folders for components, utilities, library files, data, and pages.
- **State Management**: Redux and Redux Toolkit for efficient state management.
- **Routing**: React Router for managing navigation.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive, utility-based styling.
- **Initial Data**: JSON file for initial data simulation.

## Project Structure

This project follows a modular folder structure to maintain separation of concerns and enhance scalability. Key folders include `components`, `pages`, `lib`, `data`, and `utils`.

### Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend framework for building user interfaces.
- **Redux + Redux Toolkit**: State management.
- **React Router**: Routing library.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn**

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Amzat19/alumunite-task.git
   cd alumunite-task
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

   The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- **Adding New Components**: Place reusable UI components in the `components` folder.
- **State Management**: Use Redux Toolkit in the `lib/redux` folder to manage global state. Redux actions, reducers.
- **Types**: Types are located in the `lib` folder.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS is configured for custom styles and can be extended in `tailwind.config.js`.
- **Routing**: Define new routes in the `pages` folder, and manage navigation using `React Router` in `App.tsx`.

### Folder Descriptions

- **`components`**: Contains reusable UI components.
- **`data`**: Holds JSON files for initial data (e.g., mock user data).
- **`lib`**: Stores `redux` folder (for state management configuration and slices) and `types` folder (for global TypeScript types).
- **`pages`**: Contains individual pages tied to specific routes.
- **`utils`**: Contains helper functions (e.g., `generateUniqueId`).

## Customization

- **Tailwind CSS Customization**: Modify `tailwind.config.js` to add or change styles for your app.
- **Redux**: Add new slices in `lib/redux` as needed. Use `configureStore` in `store.ts` to combine slices.
- **Routing**: Define new routes in `App.tsx` and add components for each route under `pages`.

## Known Limitations

- **Basic Authentication**: No authentication layer is currently implemented. Add authentication for restricted or role-based access if needed.
- **Static Data**: Currently relies on initial JSON data stored locally. For dynamic data, connect with a backend API.
- **Limited Test Coverage**: Initial tests are minimal; it’s recommended to add unit and integration tests for robustness in production.
- **Scoped to Small Projects**: While modular, this structure is designed for mid-size projects. For larger applications, consider further splitting logic by domain and feature.
