# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Organized structure with separate folders for components, utilities, library files, data, and pages.
- **State Management**: Redux and Redux Toolkit for efficient state management.
- **Routing**: React Router for managing navigation.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive, utility-based styling.
- **Initial Data**: JSON file for initial data simulation.

## Project Structure

This project follows a modular folder structure to maintain separation of concerns and enhance scalability. Key folders include `components`, `pages`, `lib`, `data`, and `utils`.

### Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend framework for building user interfaces.
- **Redux + Redux Toolkit**: State management.
- **React Router**: Routing library.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn**

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Amzat19/alumunite-task.git
   cd alumunite-task
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

   The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- **Adding New Components**: Place reusable UI components in the `components` folder.
- **State Management**: Use Redux Toolkit in the `lib/redux` folder to manage global state. Redux actions, reducers.
- **Types**: Types are located in the `lib` folder.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS is configured for custom styles and can be extended in `tailwind.config.js`.
- **Routing**: Define new routes in the `pages` folder, and manage navigation using `React Router` in `App.tsx`.

```

### Folder Descriptions

- **`components`**: Contains reusable UI components.
- **`data`**: Holds JSON files for initial data (e.g., mock user data).
- **`lib`**: Stores `redux` folder (for state management configuration and slices) and `types` folder (for global TypeScript types).
- **`pages`**: Contains individual pages tied to specific routes.
- **`utils`**: Contains helper functions (e.g., `generateUniqueId`).

## Customization

- **Tailwind CSS Customization**: Modify `tailwind.config.js` to add or change styles for your app.
- **Redux**: Add new slices in `lib/redux` as needed. Use `configureStore` in `store.ts` to combine slices.
- **Routing**: Define new routes in `App.tsx` and add components for each route under `pages`.

## Known Limitations

- **Basic Authentication**: No authentication layer is currently implemented. Add authentication for restricted or role-based access if needed.
- **Static Data**: Currently relies on initial JSON data stored locally. For dynamic data, connect with a backend API.
- **Limited Test Coverage**: Initial tests are minimal; it’s recommended to add unit and integration tests for robustness in production.
- **Scoped to Small Projects**: While modular, this structure is designed for mid-size projects. For larger applications, consider further splitting logic by domain and feature.
